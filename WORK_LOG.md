One idea I thought of was using that fact that I only needed two bits to store each nucleotide, while right now they are stored as conventional 2 byte (8 bit) char. This would fulfill the 30% criteria for this problem set. |

The first thing I did was create maps to switch between the nucleotides and their corresponding integers in constant time. From there, in the compress function all I had to do was change the nucleotide to their corresponding 0-3 integer and write it out as 2 bits. For the expand, I took the 2 bits, found the corresponding int, and wrote out the nucleotide related to it. After many errors, the code finally worked, but I still had a weird problem where three null characters would appear in front of each character. I am trying to address that now. |
| Nov 16 |  6:45-7pm   | I fixed the null character error very easily by telling the computer to specifically write out each character in 8 bits instead of its default 32. However, once I did this, a new error appeared where extra A's would be at the end of the expanded file. I am not sure at all why this is happening. After doing a bit of research, I realized that "padding bits" were being added when the # of nucleotides isn't a multiple of four. To fix this, I have to store the # of nucleotides when I compress the file so the expansion works correctly. Now, the before and after files are identical! The compression ratio was also very good for the virus, and slightly not as good for the genome, which makes sense because storing the "length" int takes up more space compared to the whole thing for genome because it is shorter.  |
