One idea I thought of was using that fact that I only needed two bits to store each nucleotide, while right now they are stored as conventional 2 byte (8 bit) char. This would fulfill the 30% criteria for this problem set. |
| Nov 16 | 5:00-6:35 | I coded in the compress and expand functions. The first thing I did was create maps to switch between the nucleotides and their corresponding integers in constant time. From there, in the compress function all I had to do was change the nucleotide to their corresponding 0-3 integer and write it out as 2 bits. For the expand, I took the 2 bits, found the corresponding int, and wrote out the nucleotide related to it. After many errors, the code finally worked, but I still had a weird problem where three null characters would appear in front of each character. I am trying to address that now.  |
